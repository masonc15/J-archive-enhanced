# J-Archive Enhanced Userscript

## Description

J-Archive Enhanced is a Tampermonkey userscript designed to improve the experience of browsing the [J-Archive](https://j-archive.com/) website (a fan-created archive of Jeopardy! games). It allows users to easily show or hide all Jeopardy! answers on both search results and individual game pages with a single click.

## Features

- Adds a "Show/Hide all answers" button that toggles the visibility of answers on the J-Archive website.
- Works on both the search results pages and individual game pages.
- Simple, unobtrusive interface integrated into the J-Archive website design.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have the Tampermonkey extension installed in your browser.
   - [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://tampermonkey.net/?ext=dhdg&browser=chrome)
   - [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://tampermonkey.net/?ext=dhdg&browser=firefox)
   - [Tampermonkey for Safari](https://tampermonkey.net/?ext=dhdg&browser=safari)
   - Other browsers may also support Tampermonkey.
2. Download the `J-Archive_Plus_Enhanced.user.js` script.
3. Open Tampermonkey's dashboard in your browser.
4. Click on the "Utilities" tab.
5. Under "Import -> From File", choose the downloaded script.
6. Review the script, then click "Install" when prompted.

Alternatively, you can click on the raw version of the script from the GitHub repository to prompt Tampermonkey to install it directly.
